# DevOps

Hard to define specifically, as there is much discussion on how to define the concept. However, can agree on some practical definitions:

- A collaboration of Development and operations
- A culture promoting collaboration between Development and Operations tea to deploy code to production faster in automated and repeatable ways.
- A practice of development and operation engineers taking part in the whole service lifecycle together
- An approach that allows quicker and more reliable development of superior quality software

Academic deifnition

"A set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality."

## DevOps Lifecycle

- Continuous Development
- Continuous Testing
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous deployment
- Continuous Monitoring

# CI/CD (Continuous Integration/ Continuous Deployment)

- Continuous Integration 
  - Coding philosophy/ set of practices
  - Drive to implement small changes and check in code to version control more often
  - Aim is ot establish consistent, automated way of building, packaging and testing applications
  - Consistency in integration process, teams are likely to commit more frequently, leading to better colaboration and software quality

- Continuous Deployment 
  - Automate the delivery of applications to production environment, or other selected ifnrastructure. 



## The principles of CI/CD are part of the DevOps Lifecycle. 

Cannot always have continuous delivery. In some sectors, lengthy testing is required before deployment is permitted.

## WHY CI/CD

- Reduce cost
- Faster Release Rate
- Smaller Code Changes
- Fault Isolation
- Reliable testing
- Increased transparency & accountability
- Easy maintenance and updates
